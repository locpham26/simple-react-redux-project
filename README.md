# simple-react-redux-project
# This is a simple user interface of an e-commerce website which sells drinks built with React and Redux.
# In this project, I demonstrate how the web pages change in response to certain actions such as adding, removing, incrementing, and decrementing a drink to/from the shopping cart.
